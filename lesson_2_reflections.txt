oops, I was typing all my reflections on lesson one. I'll fix that going forward.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area allows you to set up the repository with files that you want to track. This gives finer control over what gets committed and what does not.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area can tell you the difference between your working directory and what is in the staging area. You can see logical changes and decide what to commit.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would work on a remote repository when a group of people are collaborating on a project, or if you are going to move from
  one computer to another it might be a good idea to use the remote repository so you have access from more than
  one location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You may not be ready for the changes that were updated on the remote repository, or you might not agree with those changes and don't want them incorporated into your code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are on Github. They allow you to make a copy that refrences someone elses commits and their body of work.
	Clones also make a copy of a repository, you can clone from Github down to your local pc.
	When someone else has started a project and you want to use it as a base, but add your own content you should fork it. You should clone that forked data down to your computer so you can edit it locally.
